# SixFourDev's Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation to build this webpage was to begin my new journey with web development and coding. I built this project to help myself, and other students, stay organized throughout the bootcamp and add my notes throughout the course. This webpage helps myself and others stay more organized with their notes and easy to navigate through key topics we've learned. I've learned how to use HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript, and how to successfully deploy it to mainnet.

## Usage

The goal of this webpage is for bootcamp students to view notes to certain topics we've learned in sections: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), a console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. It will provide you a list of the topics we learned from Prework with a suggestion on which topic to study first!
